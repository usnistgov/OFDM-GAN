# NIST Opensource Portal repositories categories and themes.
# Source: https://www.nist.gov/topics
# Choose one catgeory and at least one theme as you think
# adequate for your opensource repository.
# Uncomment the category and the research
# themes that suit you best.
# You are also able to provide further details on the choices.
# For example you could do:
# categories:
#   - scientific-software:
#     - quantum-computing
#     - theory
# Since scientific-software is most common it is left as default.
# Feel free to comment it with a dash if not appropriate.
# You are able to pick multiple categories and themes.
# Unlike categories there is no default theme.
# Note: Make sure to remove unwanted categories in the repository
# topics. The final topics are produced from this file and the topics.
